1648354304,Highlight,151,“big rocks theory.” It’s the well-known story of a teacher who picks up a large empty jar. She pours in some small pebbles at the bottom. Then she tries to place some larger rocks on top. The problem is that they don’t fit. The teacher then gets a new empty container of the same size. This time she puts the large rocks in first. Then the small pebbles in second. This time they fit.
1648365095,Highlight,189,Essentialism was about doing the right things; Effortless is about doing them in the right way.
1648385386,Highlight,222,"When our brains are at full capacity, everything feels harder. Fatigue slows us down."
1648385650,Highlight,245,"Anything Can Be Made Effortless, but Not Everything"
1648386427,Highlight,270,The best free throw shooter ever is not Michael Jordan or Steph Curry. It’s Elena Delle Donne. Her success rate at the free throw line across her career is 93.4 percent. That’s not just the highest in WNBA history but higher than any player in NBA history as well. If

1648386727,Highlight,285,"Our brain’s processing capacity is large, but limited. It already processes over six thousand thoughts a day."
1648386735,Highlight,283,"negative emotions, and toxic thought patterns—you have less mental energy available to perform what’s most essential."
1648398909,Highlight,303,"When you return to your Effortless State, you feel lighter,"
1648398945,Highlight,307,"The Effortless State is one in which you are physically rested, emotionally unburdened, and mentally energized."
1648431201,Highlight,332,The problem is that the complexity of modern life has created a false dichotomy between things that are “essential and hard” and things that are “easy and trivial.”
1648431620,Highlight,347,"This bias is sometimes called the cognitive ease principle, or the principle of least effort."
1648431631,Highlight,346,"Our brain is wired to resist what it perceives as hard and welcome what it perceives as easy. This bias is sometimes called the cognitive ease principle, or the principle of least effort."
1648604574,Highlight,489,"As a result, not only do more people participate, they actually look forward to participating again, year after year."
1648604765,Highlight,511,But essential activities don’t have to be enjoyed only in retrospect. We can also experience joy in the activity itself. We simply reduce the lag time between the action and satisfaction by pairing the essential activity with a reward.
1648605266,Highlight,538,"“if we can break down the processes into those steps, we may find ways to make the steps more bearable, or better yet, fun.”"
1648605305,Highlight,541,So why not pair it with running on the treadmill or doing the dishes or returning phone calls?

1648640798,Highlight,656,"When you focus on something you are thankful for, the effect is instant. It immediately shifts you from a lack state (regrets, worries about the future, the feeling of being behind) and puts you into a have state (what is going right, what progress you are making, what potential exists in this moment)."
1648640922,Highlight,664,The broaden-and-build theory in psychology offers an explanation for why this is the case. Positive emotions open us to new perspectives and possibilities.
1648640967,Highlight,671,"When you focus on what you have, you get what you lack."
1648641291,Highlight,680,a system is self-sustaining if it requires less and less investment of energy over time.
1648653427,Highlight,698,"We can apply this idea to make gratitude a habit, by using the following recipe: After I complain I will say something I am thankful for."
1648738608,Highlight,788,Rest proved an antidote for both pre-existing and future stress.
1648738819,Highlight,811,"In fact, one study found that the best-performing athletes, musicians, chess players, and writers all honed their skills in the same way: by practicing in the morning, in three sessions of sixty to ninety minutes, with breaks in between. Meanwhile, those who took fewer or shorter breaks performed less well."
1648740298,Highlight,814,"“To maximize gains from long-term practice,” the study’s lead author, K. Anders Ericsson, concluded, “individuals must avoid exhaustion and must limit practice to an amount from which they can completely recover on a daily or weekly basis.”"
1648740583,Highlight,843,"When we are struggling, instead of doubling down on our efforts, we might consider pausing the action—even for one minute."
1648824947,Highlight,875,"Healthy adults spend an average of 13 to 23 percent of their night in deep sleep. So if you sleep for seven hours, that translates to just fifty to one hundred minutes in a deep state."
1648825120,Highlight,894,"“What’s amazing is that in a 90-minute nap, you can get the same [learning] benefits as an eight-hour sleep period,” the researcher says."
1648866096,Highlight,962,It’s not the noticing itself that’s hard. It’s ignoring all the noise in our environment that is hard.
1648959498,Highlight,1010,The first type of response is what they call “turning toward.”
1648959570,Highlight,1014,The second kind of response is “turning against.”
1648959599,Highlight,1018,The third kind of response is “turning away.”
1648959630,Highlight,1021,"According to Gottman’s research, both of the first two responses—even the argumentative one—are generally healthy for a relationship. The one that does the most damage is the third kind."
1648959748,Highlight,1025,"We don’t need to agree with the other person on everything. But we do need to be present with them, to really notice them, to give them our full attention—maybe not always, but as frequently as we can."

1648960133,Highlight,1056,"Second, the moment our judgments and opinions are voiced, they compete for the limited mental space others need to draw their own conclusions."
1648960289,Highlight,1070,"But in the Effortless State, it becomes far easier to give the gift of our intentional focus to the people and things we really care about."

1648960748,Highlight,1123,"Past a certain point, more effort doesn’t produce better performance. It sabotages our performance."
1648981460,Highlight,1176,"If you want to make something hard, indeed truly impossible, to complete, all you have to do is make the end goal as vague as possible."
1648996821,Highlight,1187,I define “done” as the point just before the effort invested begins to be greater than the output achieved.
1648997214,Highlight,1219,"As you write the list, one test is to imagine how you will feel once this work is completed. Ask yourself, “If I complete everything on this list, will it leave me feeling satisfied by the end of the day? Is there some other important task that will haunt me all night if I don’t get to it?” If your answer to the second question is yes, that is a task that should go on the Done for the Day list."
1648997597,Highlight,1264,"But once we break that step down into concrete, physical actions, that first obvious action begins to feel effortless."
1648997873,Highlight,1298,we can opt for taking the minimum viable first action: the action that will allow us to gain the maximum learning from the least amount of effort.
1648998047,Highlight,1316,In recent years neuroscientists and psychologists have found that the “now” we experience lasts only 2.5 seconds. This is our psychological present.
1648998136,Highlight,1326,Looking at that first step or action through the lens of 2.5 seconds is the change that makes every other change possible. It is the habit of habits.
1649071505,Highlight,1354,"No matter how simple the step, it’s still easier to take no step."
1649071827,Highlight,1379,"To be clear, identifying the minimum"
1649071842,Highlight,1379,number of steps is not the same as “phoning it in” or producing something you are not proud of.
1649083216,Highlight,1389,Being asked to do X isn’t a good enough reason to do Y.

1649084162,Highlight,1487,"don’t try to get everything exactly right the first time. Instead, embrace the rubbish “no matter how ugly it is” so you can crash, repair, modify, and redesign fast."
1649084466,Highlight,1507,"The faster they make those mistakes, the faster they will progress."
1649176028,Highlight,1510,There is no mastery without mistakes. And there is no learning later without the courage to be rubbish.
1649176105,Highlight,1516,That was in fact my goal: to get them wrong as quickly as possible so I could see the correct answers. I didn’t want to waste time and energy on what I already knew; I wanted to see what I didn’t know so I could focus only on that.
1649176135,Highlight,1519,Make Failure as Cheap as Possible
1649176342,Highlight,1529,That’s because he got to learn from his mistakes while the risks were lower.
1649176592,Highlight,1538,Protect Your Rubbish from the Harsh Critic in Your Head
1649176725,Highlight,1555,Even rubbish words are more powerful than a blank page.
1649176770,Highlight,1559,"By embracing imperfection, by having the courage to be rubbish, we can begin. And once we begin, we become a little less rubbish, and then a little less. And eventually, out of the rubbish come exceptional, effortless breakthroughs in the things that matter."
1649207830,Highlight,1608,The problem is that going too fast at the beginning will almost always slow us down the rest of the way.
1649207923,Highlight,1622,"Holding back when you still have steam in you might seem like a counterintuitive approach to getting important things done, but in fact, this kind of restraint is key to breakthrough productivity."
1649208179,Highlight,1658,"When you go slow, things are smoother. You have time to observe, to plan, to coordinate efforts."
1649208190,Highlight,1658,But go too slow and you may get stuck or lose your momentum.
1649208459,Highlight,1665,"Simply use the following rule: Never less than X, never more than Y."

1649244360,Highlight,1821,"Depending on which lever you push, an equally modest amount of effort can also produce amazingly bad residual results."
1649244606,Highlight,1841,"Principles, however, can be applied broadly and repeatedly."
1649244866,Highlight,1872,"The commonality was a principle that he dubbed “mirrored reciprocation,” or, in simpler terms, “You get what you give.”"
1649245135,Highlight,1892,"“It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree—make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.”"
1649245382,Highlight,1903,"He is living proof that by understanding things at their most fundamental level, we can apply them in new and surprising ways."
1649245619,Highlight,1915,"He believes that by combining learnings from a range of disciplines—psychology, history, mathematics, physics, philosophy, biology, and more—we produce something that is greater than the sum of its parts."
1649258912,Highlight,1922,the best new ideas usually come from combining existing knowledge in one field with an “intrusion of unusual combinations” from other disciplines.
1649259036,Highlight,1938,The typical American reads (or partially reads) only four books a year. More than a quarter of Americans don’t read books at all.
1649259130,Highlight,1948,"If you summarize the key learnings from a book you just read, you absorb it more deeply."
1649259353,Highlight,1975,Being good at what nobody is doing is better than being great at what everyone is doing. But being an expert in something nobody is doing is exponentially more valuable.
1649259507,Highlight,1983,"In other words, once you develop a reputation for knowing what no one else knows, opportunities flow to you for years."
1649259908,Highlight,2022,There is no better way to teach than through the power of stories.
1649260213,Highlight,2049,"If you try to teach people everything about everything, you run the risk of teaching them nothing. You will achieve residual results faster if you clearly identify—then simplify—the most important messages you want to teach others to teach. These messages should be not just easy to understand but also hard to misunderstand."
1649294091,Highlight,2085,The staggering volume and complexity of know-how has exceeded experts’ ability to manage it. And this is exactly why tragic accidents happen.
1649294430,Highlight,2095,"What we need, Gawande argues, is a modest but marvelous tool: the checklist."
1649294453,Highlight,2101,The beauty of the checklist is that the thinking has been done ahead of time. It’s been taken out of the equation.
1649294634,Highlight,2121,Making decisions is mentally draining.

1649329101,Highlight,2257,"Warren Buffett uses three criteria for determining who is trustworthy enough to hire or to do business with. He looks for people with integrity, intelligence, and initiative, though he adds that without the first, the other two can backfire."
1649329651,Highlight,2281,"There are three parties to every relationship: Person A, Person B, and the structure that governs them."
1649330056,Highlight,2314,"High-Trust Agreement Results: What results do we want? Roles: Who is doing what? Rules: What minimum viable standards must be kept? Resources: What resources (people, money, tools) are available and needed? Rewards: How will progress be evaluated and rewarded?"
1649330460,Highlight,2348,"This is what I call the long tail of time management. When we invest our time in actions with a long tail, we continue to reap the benefits over a long period."
1649330536,Highlight,2353,"To break this habit, ask yourself: What is a problem that irritates me repeatedly? What is the total cost of managing that over several years? What is the next step I can take immediately, in a few minutes, to move toward solving it?"
1649344149,Highlight,2580,"In each moment, we have a choice: Do I choose the heavier or the lighter path?"
1649344489,Highlight,3325,"He would evaluate requests based on the timid criteria, “Can I actually fulfill this request, given the time and resources I have?” If the answer was no then he would refuse the request."
1649344501,Highlight,3328,"Now when a request would come in he would pause and evaluate the request against a tougher criteria: “Is this the very most important thing I should be doing with my time and resources right now?” If he couldn’t answer a definitive yes, then he would refuse the request."
1649344958,Highlight,3372,Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done.
