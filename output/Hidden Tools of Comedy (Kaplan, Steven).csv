1638089500,Highlight,231,"more important than knowing how to make something funny — which all of us have done to one extent or another — is knowing what to fix when it’s not funny. Because that’s the real problem,"
1638426591,Highlight,262,"These tools are meant to be used to fix things when they aren’t working. They are not supposed to be a method, a kind of a dramaturgical meat grinder, processing every thought, idea, or inspiration that you have."
1642921658,Highlight,439,"Isaac Caesar (that’s Sid to you) observed, “Comedy has to be based on truth. You take the truth and you put a little curlicue at the end.”"
1642921728,Highlight,447,Comedy is the art of telling the truth about what it’s like to be human.
1643007971,Highlight,596,"Drama helps us dream about what we could be, but comedy helps us live with who we are."
1643025994,Highlight,641,"Every thing we do, we do with the hopeful (at times deluded) idea that it will improve our lives."
1643026223,Highlight,661,The art of comedy is the art of hope.
1643026528,Highlight,694,Comedy is about an ordinary guy or gal struggling against insurmountable odds without many of the required skills and tools with which to win yet never giving up hope.
1643161130,Highlight,735,The tools are: 1. Winning 2. Non-Hero 3. Metaphorical Relationship 4. Positive (or Selfish) Action 5. Active Emotion 6. Straight Line/Wavy Line And the script development tools: 7. Archetype 8. Comic Premise
1643161163,Highlight,744,"Winning is the idea that, in comedy, you are allowed to do whatever you think you need to do in order to win, no matter how stupid or crass or idiotic it makes you look."
1643161176,Highlight,745,Comedy gives the character the permission to win.
1643161199,Highlight,746,"In Winning, you’re not trying to be funny, you’re just trying to get what you want, given who you are."
1643247464,Highlight,841,The point is to tell the story.
1643247489,Highlight,843,The first tool in comedy is do what you need to do in order to “win.”
1643248305,Highlight,909,"Also thus looking like an idiot, also thus creating comedy."
1643282895,Highlight,930,"Given the fact that human beings are involved, conflict is inevitable."
1643710007,Highlight,1510,"Their solution, their “win” creates the comedy; the comedy doesn’t create the solution."
1643710194,Highlight,1530,"Story and character first, and comedy will follow."
1644249096,Highlight,1927,Comedy is the by-product of the character’s actions;
1644285081,Highlight,1935,"Comedy tells the truth that our lives and our behaviors are often illogical, irrational, or inappropriate, or sometimes all three simultaneously."
1644285277,Highlight,1955,A Hero can be anyone who has skills and aptitudes.
1644332588,Highlight,2191,"“We seem to assume that the more perfect we appear — the more flawless — the more we will be loved. Actually, the reverse is more apt to be true. The more willing we are to admit our weaknesses as human beings, the more lovable we are.” — Everett Shostrom, Man The Manipulator"
1644889442,Highlight,2485,“Humor is something that thrives between man’s aspirations and his limitations.” — Victor Borge
1653614401,Highlight,2765,"When your characters give up hope, that’s when you have drama. But until they do, they’re bumbling around creating comedy."
1653614427,Highlight,2767,Jokes are not the most important element in a comedy. Characters are.
1653835999,Highlight,2778,"It’s a taking in; it’s about seeing, it’s about hearing, how you perceive things with your rods and cones. And your perceptions can often be expressed as similes or metaphors."
1653960505,Highlight,2795,"• The essential relationship beneath the surface relationship — the Metaphorical Relationship. • A character’s unique way of seeing the world: what we call World View. or • The writer/director/actor’s unique way of seeing a scene, or Frames."
1653967384,Highlight,2833,"Put simply, you don’t have to make stuff up. You’re sharing from things that you know or things that you’ve lived through. In fact, the more you can share what your truth is, the funnier it will be."
1655100076,Highlight,3042,"It gives actors a chance to play a highly emotional scene, and actors love emotion, because emotion’s like a drug."
1655521962,Highlight,3061,"“The tragedy of many people’s lives is that, given a choice between being ‘right’ and having the opportunity to be happy, they invariably choose being ‘right.’ That is the one ultimate satisfaction they allow themselves.”"
1656823056,Highlight,3136,"Sometimes the metaphor is a Frame, meaning that we (the writer, director, or actor) see the entire scene in a certain way."
1657425645,Highlight,3747,Positive Action can also be thought of as selfish action.
1657426972,Highlight,3853,Fawlty Towers
1657546117,Highlight,4059,"When a character plays a negative action, the result is drama."
1657546382,Highlight,4084,"And if you simply react in a natural, normal way, that will be the correct emotional state for the characters to be in. You don’t have to pretend an emotion."
1657547993,Highlight,4244,"Straight Line/Wavy Line is: • The one who does not see and the one who does. • The one blind to, or creating, the problem, and the one struggling with the problem. • The essential dynamic of comic focus, not character."
1657675432,Highlight,5085,"Because the Wavy Line is just reacting as our representative, as us, and when the Wavy Line does speak, his dialogue just has to be simple, direct, and honest."
1657882712,Highlight,5598,"Once the premise is established, YOU CANNOT TELL ANOTHER LIE."
1657882947,Highlight,5608,"All action flows honestly and organically from the premise, based on character."
1657882983,Highlight,5612,Characters are brought on through NEED and THEME.
1657882989,Highlight,5613,Premise is the engine; Theme is the rudder.
1657940523,Highlight,5630,"By calling in the wrong character, the theme, and the movie itself, is sidetracked and diminished."
1657940529,Highlight,5631,Characters determine Events and Structure; Events and Structure should not dictate to Character.
1657940555,Highlight,5633,Other characters’ needs are as strong as the main character’s.
1657941173,Highlight,5667,But my take on jokes in narratives is that they need to accomplish four things: 1. Further the Action 2. Define Character 3. Deliver A Unique View of the World 4. Be Compressed
1657941293,Highlight,5674,"If all you can come up with is a weak response, it’s better just to keep the story going by having the response be something along the order of a dryly delivered “Thanks.”"
1657941512,Highlight,5681,So a joke has to define character.
1658081382,Highlight,5691,"The way a joke works — the physiology of a joke, the neurology of a joke — is that our brains create little highways called neural pathways, and a joke is going down that pathway, and all of a sudden the punch line creates a detour, and the thought has to create a new neural pathway."
1658081450,Highlight,5696,"If you give too much information, they just go, yeah, OK, makes sense. If you don’t give enough information, they go, huh? So you have to give them just enough information to play along."
1658081678,Highlight,5728,B: MAN WEARING A TOP HAT SLIPPING ON A BANANA PEEL represents social comedy or comedy of manners.
1658081685,Highlight,5731,"C: MAN SLIPPING ON A BANANA PEEL AFTER KICKING A DOG is revenge comedy, or satire."
1658193945,Highlight,5744,E: BLIND MAN SLIPPING ON A BANANA PEEL is meant to refer to “black” comedy.
1658194034,Highlight,5753,F: BLIND MAN’S DOG SLIPPING ON A BANANA PEEL represents the comedy of alienation or contemporary comedy.
1658194102,Highlight,5758,D: BLIND MAN SLIPPING ON A BANANA PEEL AFTER LOSING HIS JOB.
1658194139,Highlight,5762,There really are only two un-comic sentences — the first and the last. The first — A: MAN SLIPPING ON A BANANA PEEL – because it lacks details.
1658194168,Highlight,5765,Lack of detail is what separates the mundane from the comic.
1658194254,Highlight,5772,G: MAN SLIPS ON A BANANA PEEL AND DIES – is their pick for the funniest.
1658194281,Highlight,5774,But it’s not death that I think is not comic; it’s the death of hope.
1658274008,Highlight,5797,"First, read Chad Gervich’s book Small Screen, Big Picture and Ellen Sandler’s The TV Writer’s Workbook."
1658274020,Highlight,5798,"I can share with you the Seven Secrets of Highly Successful Sitcom Writers: SECRET #1: Before you start to write your spec, you need to find out what agents, managers, development and show runners are reading these days."
1658293170,Highlight,5816,SECRET #3: The next important step is coming up with a strong story.
1658293249,Highlight,5819,"On the other hand, don’t wait until Page 8 to introduce the conflict."
1658293394,Highlight,5829,"SECRET #4: The writers’ group is an indispensable tool for comedy, because comedy doesn’t exist in a vacuum."
1658294527,Highlight,5840,"SECRET #5 — that you have to sit down and make a list of everyone,"
1658366794,Highlight,5956,Six Step Story Structure.
1658367341,Highlight,6000,One approach is not to worry about what you say; focus on who you are. Always play the character.
1658367504,Highlight,6006,"There is one caveat: a script that’s laden with bad jokes. The approach here is if you can’t pitch a better one to the director, then ask the jokes to be removed, or better yet, get someone else to say them."
1658376564,Highlight,6025,The biggest mistake in comedy is trying too hard to make your characters funny. Let them be human — that’s funny enough.
1658376586,Highlight,6026,"Another error is writers thinking that they’re superior to the characters they’re writing, not believing in the humanity of their own characters, and working overtime to invent ridiculous behavior in a strained effort to “be funny.”"
1658378921,Highlight,6039,One way to make a stereotypical character un-stereotypical is to model the character on someone you really know.
1658379880,Highlight,6053,"While there are a number of successful approaches to structuring a joke, the first and most important thing to work on is character."
